Hey Brian

I'm a 4th Computing Student (DT211/4) doing final year project. My project surrounds Home-based rehabilitation of patients with cardio-vascular diseases using exercises and serious games. I want to include a cloud-based portion to the project where exercises performed at home by patients are sent to a clous-based database which the doctor could remotely log into to view patients progression. I was looking at windows Azure and using mongoDB, but was wondering if we chat about it and you can give input and input on any other technologies you would recommend using.

Thanks
